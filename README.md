## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS animations
- Scss syntax 

### What I learned

Implementing the animations was painful, but it was worth every second! It is a very basic one, but it is my first (of many, or so I hope).

### Continued development

The code a lot of room for improvement, including organization and best practices. PS: for some reason, when I run the code locally, it all works great, but once I run it on the server, it seems no to load some of the assets used in the background. I will put some effort into figuring that out.

### Useful resources

- [Google Web Dev - Animations](https://web.dev/learn/css/animations/) - Here's where I got the basics of animation properties.
